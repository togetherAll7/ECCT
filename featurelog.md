## New Features

### (2023-11-18) EcctrlJoystick:

- Ecctrl now supports touch screen control!

- You can easily import and use the built-in 3D joystick.
  (note: place EcctrlJoystick outside of the canvas component)

```js
import Ecctrl, {EcctrlJoystick} from 'ecctrl'
//...
  <EcctrlJoystick />
  <Canvas>
    {/* ... */}
  </Canvas>
//...
```

- For more detailed settings, including lights, materials, and textures, please refer to the following sections.

- Additionally, I've prepared a simple [Ecctrl CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/ecctrl-w-o-animations-3k3zxt) for online testing and demostration.

- Also, here is another [Ecctrl CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/ecctrl-with-animations-nr4493) showcasing character animation functionality.

### (2023-10-02) Pmndrs/ecctrl & npm package:

- The character controller now integrated with [pmndrs/ecctrl](https://github.com/pmndrs/ecctrl)

- You can easily install the npm package using the following command:

```bash
npm install ecctrl
```

To get started, import `Ecctrl` and `EcctrlAnimation`, then wrap your character model within `<Ecctrl>`:

```js
import Ecctrl, {EcctrlAnimation} from 'ecctrl'
...
  <Ecctrl>
    <CharacterModel/>
  </Ecctrl>
...
```

- Additionally, I've prepared a simple [Ecctrl CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/ecctrl-w-o-animations-3k3zxt) for online testing and demostration.

### (2023-09-13) New Character & Physics Enhancements:

- Incorporate 11 dynamic animations with new floating character, Uncle Pete
- Implement action and reaction forces on frictionless floating platforms:
  - Platforms now move opposite to the character's moving direction (Having less impact on havier platforms)
  - Character also applies drag force (friction) to the standing platform
  - Character's free fall height now impacts on platform reaction forces
  - Add extra downward force upon character jumps for more realistic physics
